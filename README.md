Study Notes on TCP/IP Network Programming
==
About this book
--
Computer network is one of the basic knowledge modules in the computer field, and it is also one of the modules that major Internet companies focus on during campus recruitment interviews.

When I was learning computer networks, the introductory book I read was "Computer Networks ( Xie Xiren )" ( note link ), and then I read "TCP/IP Network Programming" and "Linux High Performance Server Programming" for advanced reading.

The content of this book is relatively basic, simple, and clearly explained, and can be used to quickly get started with network programming.

Who should read this book?
-
Suitable for people who are planning to go into C++ backend development, as a basic book for advanced computer network modules.

Notes Overview
-
The study notes in this project are notes I took after finishing a chapter and refining its key points. The notes contain the knowledge points and valuable code examples that I think I need to remember when studying.

Notes for
-
After reading "TCP/IP Network Programming" once, you can check this note to review and sort out the learning content.

I am currently reading "TCP/IP Network Programming". I don't have the energy or don't want to take notes. I can review my notes after finishing each chapter to sort out what I have learned.

If you need to check the knowledge points in "TCP/IP Network Programming", you can check them through this notebook.

When you want to learn network programming quickly, this notebook can also be a substitute for "TCP/IP Network Programming".
